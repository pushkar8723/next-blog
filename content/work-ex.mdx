Like most developers, I spend a lot of my time solving problems for the company I work for.
So, here I list them down.

## LinkedIn

```
Senior Software Engineer - UI | Mar 2025 - present
```

I joined the LinkedIn Business Platform team and am excited to see what new problem I will get to work on.

## Flipkart

```
UI Developer III | Apr 2022 - Mar 2025
UI Developer II  | Sep 2019 - Mar 2022
UI Developer     | Mar 2018 - Sep 2019
```

I joined the [Ads Platform](https://brands.flipkart.com) team at [Flipkart](https://www.flipkart.com) in early 2018
and was part of the UI team responsible for managing the frontend of the Ads Platform. During my tenure,
I contributed to multiple projects, one of the most notable being the integration with [Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/in)
to enable [video advertisements on the platform](https://inc42.com/buzz/flipkart-hotstar-launch-advertising-platform-shopper-audience-network/).
Additionally, I played a key role in enabling
[multi-language support](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/flipkart-launches-hindi-interface-to-tap-into-next-200-million-e-shoppers/articleshow/70964751.cms?from=mdr) on Flipkart.

After my tenure in Ads, I transitioned to the [Flipkart Wholesale](https://www.bestprice.in/) team, where I was involved
in building the warehouse platform from the ground up. **I led a team of 4-5 developers, mentored them and worked with the
leadership** to create an application that met all the requirements and also was highly configurable to the changing
requirements. After launch and stabilization, only one engineer was required to maintain the UI application.
Additionally, I developed an automation testing framework
on top of [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) to test the warehouse platform and Flipkart Wholesale mobile applications.
For this I worked with 2 test engineers to understand their requirement and came up with a solution that was able **test the
entire warehouse workflow in ~30 minutes**.
My final project in Flipkart Wholesale was to create a no-code platform where a designer or an engineer can quickly create
a new widget and release it. This helped **saved multiple man-hour of designers, frontend and backend engineers** by
eliminating the back-and-forth discussion that was required earlier to create a widget.

Later, I had the opportunity to work on [Shopsy](https://www.shopsy.in), **Shopsy has >50 million active users.**
Here I led the development of the web platform. Our team undertook a complete rewrite of the platform using Next.js,
consolidating both mobile and desktop experiences within a single codebase. This initiative aimed to enhance web vitals,
reduce technical debt, improve developer productivity, and minimize boilerplate code.

My day-to-day responsibilities revolved around problem-solving. This includes gathering requirements
from product teams, collaborating with designers to craft intuitive user experiences, finalizing contracts
with backend teams, implementing solutions, conducting testing and deployment, mentoring juniors, aligning team with
the changes, documenting architecture and design decisions and ensuring the ongoing maintenance and optimization of
these features. Post release we saw an improvement of **~5% in the conversion rate on the web platform.**

**Tech Stack:** React, React Native, Redux, NextJS, Zustand, Apollo, GraphQL, JavaScript, TypeScript.

### Cross-Team Impact

**Platform Engineering**

- The platform I created in Ads is used by **10+ teams managing 100% of advertising pages**.
- Flipkart Wholesale Testing framework, **prevented high-severity production issues**.
- Invoicing tool helps in processing **INR 100cr+ per sale event, saving 100+ hours**.

**Technical Leadership**

- Provided architectural guidance to 10+ senior engineers across Ads, Wholesale, and Shopsy.
- Shopsy architecture patterns adopted by [Flipkart Minutes](https://www.flipkart.com/flipkart-minutes-store) team.
- Established React/Next.js standards adopted beyond immediate teams.

## OnGrid

```
Software Developer | Sep 2015 - Mar 2018
```

When I joined [OnGrid](https://www.ongrid.in), the company was just a week old and had only 4 developers. Though the size
of the dev team remained constant while I was working there, the company grew many folds. We even got listed in [YourStory's](https://yourstory.com/)
[top 30 tech startups in India](https://yourstory.com/2016/10/ongrid?utm_pageloadtype=scroll).

Here I implemented multiple solutions from scratch, made sure that iteration on these solutions should be fast and easy, and
at the same time the solution should be intuitive, responsive, and maintainable. I was solely responsible for both customer
and operations website. I also setup multiple dashboards which helped different teams in the organization in the decision
making and also gamified the the monotonous task that operations executives had to do on a daily basis.

**Tech Stack:** Angular, Polymer, JavaScript

## SAP Labs India

```

```

I got an offer from [SAP Labs India](https://www.sap.com/india/about.html) while I was pursuing my bachelor's degree at [BIT Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/).
I joined the [SAP Mobile Secure](https://portal.sapmobilesecure.com/) team. Its an [MDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device_management) platform
and while working here I gained knowledge of various design patterns used in the industry. I was involved in [Android for Work integration](https://blogs.sap.com/2015/05/18/introducing-android-for-work-for-sap-mobile-secure/)
on the platform and creating a [cloud build service for Fiori Apps](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/01/24/create-a-fiori-client-with-the-cloud-build-service-for-on-premise-fiori-launchpad/).
