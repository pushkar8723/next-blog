> TLDR: I created a Portfolio + Blog template which I optimized for web-vitals, SEO, accessibility and image delivery.
> The whole project is small and hackable with a comprehensive list of features. But I didn’t stop there. I dumped all
> the architecture and supported scenarios in an `agents.md` file so that anyone can use AI to customize it.

During Covid, when everyone was stuck at home, I started exploring my interest. I realized that I like sharing my projects
with the world. However, it was very hard to get the people to try it out with just a tweet about it. This was also the
time when I fell in love with GraphQL and was trying out everything that used GraphQL. I even created a
[Fullstack Serverless Template](/blog/fullstack-serverless-template) using Apollo. So naturally my search led me to
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

I felt that I found exactly what I needed and so I used [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)
with a lot of customizations to create my [blog](https://github.com/pushkar8723/blog). I got a lot of things correct.
It was simple, React based, used MDX for creating pages, generated RSS feed, optimized images. However, I needed few
more pages to showcase my projects and work experience. When I share links on social media, I wanted the image tile
to also show, like you see below.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style="margin: 0 auto">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
        AI can generate a “working” React form in seconds but if you don’t understand semantic HTML, ARIA, and keyboard
        behaviour, your UI will still be broken. <br><br>I wrote a blog on how to build UI components correctly using AI.

Hence, I created pages and added plugins to the starter template to have these features. I showed it to my friends
and they liked it. One friend of mine even asked me to [make it a template](https://github.com/pushkar8723/blog/issues/3).
Which I thought was a good idea.

## The Problem

## Enter v0

## The Good and the bad

## But is this customizable?

## Making the template AI-Friendly

## The Result
