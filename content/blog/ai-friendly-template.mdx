> TLDR: I created a Portfolio + Blog template which I optimized for web-vitals, SEO, accessibility and image delivery.
> The whole project is small and hackable with a comprehensive list of features. But I didn’t stop there. I dumped all
> the architecture and supported scenarios in an `agents.md` file so that anyone can use AI to customize it.

During Covid, when everyone was stuck at home, I started exploring my interests. I realized that I like sharing my projects
with the world. However, it was very hard to get the people to try it out with just a tweet about it. This was also the
time when I fell in love with GraphQL and was trying out everything that used GraphQL. I even created a
[Fullstack Serverless Template](/blog/fullstack-serverless-template) using Apollo and Netlify!

So naturally my search led me to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

I felt that I found exactly what I needed and so I used [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)
with a lot of customizations to create my [blog](https://github.com/pushkar8723/blog). It got covered a lot of features
that I require for my blog. It was simple, React based, used MDX for creating pages, generated RSS feed, optimized images.
However, I needed few more pages to showcase my projects and work experience. When I share links on social media, I wanted
the image tile to show, like the **"Building UI components correctly using AI"** card you see in the tweet below
(instead of a plain link).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
        AI can generate a “working” React form in seconds but if you don’t understand semantic HTML, ARIA, and keyboard
        behaviour, your UI will still be broken. <br><br>I wrote a blog on how to build UI components correctly using AI.

Hence, I created pages and added plugins to the starter template to have these extra features. I showed it to my friends
and they liked it. One friend of mine even asked me to [make it a template](https://github.com/pushkar8723/blog/issues/3).
Which I thought was a good idea.

## The Problem

However this is where I was hit by another realization. My blog was not easily customizable. To use Gatsby, there
is a steep learning curve. Especially if you are not familiar with UI tech stack and GraphQL. I was not satisfied
the image tile that Gatsby Plugin provided. I wanted to add few more things like subtitle, date and reading time.
I was already exhausted from configuration I had to do to add projects, pages, configuring different Gatsby plugins
and making all of these work with each other, I didn’t had the motivation left in me to make more changes.
This was before the advent of AI, hence making any change took a long time.

Thus for a long time, I wanted to move to Next.js. File based routing is simpler than Gatsby's configuration
and using `generateStaticParams` is a lot easier than writing GraphQL queries. It comes with many optimizations
to create a static website. Only downside was that there is no rich plugin ecosystem like Gatsby. So I needed to
build a lot of features manually to match what `gatsby-starter-blog` provided.

## Enter v0

Today's landscape is very different from 2020. We have AI and tools like [Replit](https://replit.com/),
[Loveable](https://lovable.dev/) and [v0](https://v0.app/). I chose v0 to create Next.js based blog as it is part
of [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) ecosystem.

I entered a prompt with a comprehensive list of features that I wanted and let it do its magic. I did needed few
corrections here and there but overall it was a great experience. In half an hour I had a working prototype with
most of the features I wanted. I did want to improve few things but thought to get more opinions before doing that.
I shared this with my friends and they too had similar feedback to what I was thinking.

## The Good and the bad

## But is this customizable?

## Making the template AI-Friendly
