Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals and best practices.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several benefits out of the box:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Improve performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-render pages at build time
- **API Routes** - Build your backend within the same project
- **File-Based Routing** - Intuitive and simple routing system

## Setting Up Your Project

Getting started is straightforward. You can create a new project using:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will scaffold a new project with all the necessary configurations.

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project follows this structure:

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── components/
├── lib/
├── public/
└── package.json
```

## Building Your First Page

Creating pages in Next.js is simple. Just add a `page.tsx` file in the `app` directory:

```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
      <p>This is built with Next.js!</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its developer experience and performance optimizations make it a go-to framework for React developers.
